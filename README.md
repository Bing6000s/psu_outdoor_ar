# AugmentedReality_RERC
The nickname "Psuedo" came from the use of psuedo-AR with the bounding boxes, not true AR but almost there. The videos located in "_Videos" will provide you with a lot of detail on where, what, and how things work.

## Recommended Tools
Use Git, Vscode, and Unity, keep it simple.
	
## Getting started in Unity
To truly understand the scope of this project the use of the following tutorial is extremely benificial. Unity has created multiple indepth and guided tutorials for how to use their engine, and when in doubt just google it!

The link is right [here](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials) if that doesnt work here is the link	https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials

## Test and Deploy
Currently the system can be run in Unity, Andriod (Samsung Galexy Flip 4), Windows (Desktop and Laptop), and expected to work and linux but needs to be tested.

## Notes
* As a side note there is a well designed Unity UI Toolkit UI that was stored and is not currently in use to scaling issues, this can be worked on at any point and modified to work too with some minor integration tweaks
* Please Ignore any old programmer art haha
* Some of the tricky parts of the code base should have comments that mention a tutorial, those are linked below in helpful tutorials
* Use Unity Docs and save time
