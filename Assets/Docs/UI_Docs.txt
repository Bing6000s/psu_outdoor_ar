## The UI is currently based on the Unity UI Toolkit

Unity is in a transitional period between two diffrent UI systems, since UI Toolkit is the new UI system this is what this system is based on.

## If you enjoy CSS this will be a joy
Once you open the UI Toolkit window via """Window > UI Toolkit > UI Builder""" you will see a window that lets you begin work on the custom UI Design.

CSS is a nightmare on mobile devices so to counteract this painpoint we push the UI in a static 16:9 aspect ratio.
